# tchackpoum-sfz

This is a virtual drum kit in SFZ format using samples recorded by Vincent
"[Tchackpoum](http://tchackpoum.fr/)" Sermone. The MIDI mappings are set up
with the intention of working for many popular drumkits (Alesis, Roland,
Simmons, et. al.) without having to futz about with MIDI note numbers.
